# Fast Screened Poisson LGF <a href="https://github.com/WeiHou1996/Fast-Screened-Poisson-LGF/blob/main/LICENSE.md"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg" />
This repository provides a set of algorithms to efficiently evaluate the lattice Green's function (LGF) of the screened Poisson equation. This LGF is the fundamental solution of the discrete screened Poisson equation. It finds its application in many areas such as:

  1. Solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
  2. Computing the return probabilities of a random walk with killing
  3. Modeling the effects of material impurities
  4. Many others...

The file "src/LGF_funcs.py" contains many methods to tabulate the LGF of the screened Poisson equation. The files in the folder "Comparisons" compare the runtime and accuracy of various methods. The files in the folder "Applications" demonstrate the potential use of the LGF of the screened Poisson equation. The scripts described above are used to generate the performance results of the following paper using an Apple M1 Pro chip.
